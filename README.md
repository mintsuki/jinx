Jinx (Jinx Is Not Xbstrap) is a meta-build-system for bootstrapping operating
system distributions inspired by [xbstrap](https://github.com/managarm/xbstrap)
and Arch Linux's [PKGBUILDs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD).

Some examples of hobby OSes using Jinx are [Lyre](https://github.com/lyre-os/lyre),
[Gloire](https://github.com/streaksu/Gloire), and [Jinix](https://github.com/48cf/jinix).
