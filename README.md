Jinx (Jinx Is Not Xbstrap) is a meta-build-system for bootstrapping operating system
distributions inspired by xbstrap (https://github.com/managarm/xbstrap).

Some documentation, along with basic instructions and an explanation of the
internals of Jinx is provided [here](DOCS.md). Some examples of hobby OSes
using Jinx are [Vinix](https://github.com/vlang/vinix)[Lyre],(https://github.com/lyre-os/lyre) and
[Gloire](https://github.com/streaksu/Gloire).
